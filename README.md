# Mobile-Device-Security-Settings-Audit---GRC-Project
This project is a security settings audit I conducted on a configuration profile used on a large group of iPads being managed via Jamf MDM. In this project I show the pre audited security settings, post audited security settings, and pre and post audited risk register.
